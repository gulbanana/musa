CAMERA SPACE
coordinate system: pixels
a camera is an XxY 2d frame. the main camera is either contained within a window, or fullscreen
world space is *projected* to camera space according to its size, aspect ratio, FOV
every time the camera needs to be reset, resize() is sent to the renderer

WORLD SPACE
coordinate system: units
the world has X, Y, Z, and potentially W or T coordinates. 

OBJECT SPACE
coordinate system: units
every entity has its own relative coordinates, without rotation or scaling, 
and an origin in the centre. these are fixed, or rather they change only if
the entity's state changes; the entity is projected from "modelobject" space
to "world"s pace in order to display it
