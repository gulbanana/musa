split ECS framework from game-mode engines to allow a text-mode game
system multithreading - dependency semaphores
messages, as a performance optimisation of polling
polling
textures, brush/mesh distinction SOMEHOW
double viewport (balls unification)
6dof controller
model loader/better resource loader in general
lighting
restore collision
skybox texture
fullscreen
wrangle gl extensions (glew/etc), and use this to get rid of more SDL dependencies
make collision detection pairwise
flat/sprite mesh
obb collision detection
make aabb detection spatial (octree)
mesh collision detection?
better bounce physics - forces? or just go straight to Bullet
change entity ownership logic (why are they shared)
gui - get fonts in
gui/renderer - labels 
gui / control - add/subtract ball (this will involve safely destroying entities)
expiring entities
state - controllable game clock
gl3/VBO renderer
linux port
wizards game
windows: sdl version which static links to msvcrt, maybe 2.0
get rid of sdlmain
longer term: get rid of sdl
windows: directx renderer
Bullet physics
